# Advent of Code 2022
This are my submissions for Advent of Code 2022. Let's see if I can finish another year of AoC!

Wait, why does this repository have a webpage?

------------

I have decided that, in addition to completing a coding challenge a day, I'll also write a story just for fun. It's basically a mashup of the story from Advent of Code, and another game that I really like. Which game? You'll see.

**Warning! The story may contain spoilers to Deltarune.**

Well, I just spoiled which game it is... Go [check out the game](https://deltarune.com)!

If you've played through it, and have completed all of the Advent of Code questions thus far, you can [read the story](https://minghinshi.github.io/Advent-of-Code-2022).
