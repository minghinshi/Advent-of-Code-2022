# About the webpage
**Warning: I'm writing this assuming that you've given Deltarune Chapters 1 & 2 a go. If you haven't, stop reading immediately.**

In September 2022, for the 4th anniversary of Deltarune, Toby Fox organized a charity  / fundraising event called [Spamton Sweepstakes](https://deltarune.com/sweepstakes). To the surprise of many players, the event also comes with an [Alternate Reality Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game). Numerous pages of content relevant to the plot of the game are scattered throughout the event webpage. Among them are [a collection of blog posts seemingly written from Noelle](https://deltarune.com/code).

[The webpage](https://minghinshi.github.io/Advent-of-Code-2022) mimics the style of her posts, and attempts to combine two very irrelevant corners of the Internet, for the sake of... for fun. Yeah. I'll try to keep the personalities of the characters as faithful as possible.

The assets (in the [assets folder](https://github.com/minghinshi/Advent-of-Code-2022/tree/main/docs/assets)) belong to Toby Fox, not me. I used them to fake the blog posts.
