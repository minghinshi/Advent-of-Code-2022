                <p>It’s the last day of November. Which means tomorrow will be… Yeah. (I still miss her…)</p>
                <p>Last year was weird. First was this cyberpunk world where I was held hostage by a computer… I thought it was a fever dream of some sort. Sometimes, Kris talked about what they did in that world, which I somehow remember… But that’s just a coincidence, right? No way that thing is real.</p>
                <p>Then it happened again, about a year ago.</p>
                <p>If you’ve been following my posts, you’ll know that it’s just crazy. Long story short… I woke up on a cruiser and was told to deliver boxes of sleigh keys into the storage room. You know, the keys that are used to start up Santa’s sleighs. Then I tripped, and… The rest is history. Really, go look at my posts last year! It’s so bizarre!</p>
                <p>Anyways, to get the keys back, Kris and I solved 50 puzzles that got harder over time. They got so hard eventually, I sometimes spent too much time on the questions and forgot to have dinner… (That can’t be healthy, right? Speaking of dinner, it’s mostly just canned vegetables.) And when we finally solved all of them and got the keys back…</p>
                <p>I woke up.</p>
                <p>Well, that’s not all. I went to bed on 30/11, and I woke up… On my birthday. Yes, I mean Christmas Day. 25/12. It’s been 25 days! Worse, the sun was already setting, so I’m about to miss out on my birthday party!</p>
                <p>I quickly got dressed, prepared myself and rushed out. Susie and Berdly were already at the front gate, waving at me much harder than usual.</p>
                <p>“Noelle! You’re here! I’m worried that you, uh, died or something.”</p>
                <p>“Ah, our damsel in distress! I couldn’t get Queen to savour my glorious Gamer’s Delight, so I baked you one instead! This time with bonus toppings!” Berdly held up his cake that looked more like a circuit board.</p>
                <p>(Yeah, Berdly, you’ve really got to improve your cooking…)</p>
                <p>“Now that everyone’s here,” Berdly continued, “let’s head off to the-”</p>
                <p>“Sorry, where’s Kris?” I asked.</p>
                <p>“Ah… right. They’re still missing.”</p>
                <p>“Missing?”</p>
                <p>Good thing Kris arrived 5 minutes later.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>I later learnt that I wasn’t dreaming. For two times, I was trapped in a “dark world”. At least that’s what that goat said, IIRC. It’s all real… Basically, someone managed to open a portal to a dark world while I was sleeping… Then I would be tricked into thinking that it’s a dream, and disregard whatever had happened.</p>
                <p>That time, Kris and I were trapped in the same dark world. And, well, it didn’t take long for everyone to know about it. But no one dared to enter it… So we were regarded as missing.</p>
                <p>Last year was weird. I hope that doesn’t happen again…</p>
